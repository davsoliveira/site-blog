## Overview

This project simulates a landing page integrated with a blog page, where users can view posts, search for content, and share articles on social media.

### My Process

In this project, we first used the Pages Router to understand how its routing works, and then migrated to the App Router. During the blog development, we implemented a CMS to explore the three core pillars of Next.js: routing, data fetching, and rendering (SSR, SSG, and ISR). We also made code optimizations to improve performance and SEO.
